## Overview of Project

Louise a playwright, wants to start a crowd funding campaign. Before starting her next project funding campaign,  she needs data in excel spreadsheet format to be visualized and analyzed to make sure her project will be successful. 

### Purpose

To help Louise to make an informative decision for her up coming fund-raising campaign, needed to develop data tables with graphs and written analysis for Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Category theater has the highest outcome of success from 2009 to 2017. Highest point of success for all years is month of May. Where successful outcome of 111 in comparison to 52 failed and 3 canceled. Even though highest point of failed for all years is also month of May, success outcome is still higher outcome, referencing to grand total, the percentage of 67% success, 31% failed and 2% as canceled. Highest point of outcome for cancelation for all years is month of Jan with 7 cancelation, 56 successful and 33 failed. Month of Dec where successful and failed are almost the same.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Comparison to subcategory play with minimum goal of less than 1000 the success outcome is 76% and  24% failed but for maximum goal greater than 50000 the success went down to 13% and 88% failed outcome.  Goal less than 1000, goal 35000 to 39999 and goal 40000 to 44999 has greater number of successes. Percentage canceled was not included in the comparison since no canceled outcomes on all goals.
 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Needed additional data, demographic information for analysis. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	I conclude that theater category fund raising has most success outcome to all categories. Highest success and failed outcomes are both for the month May, but still success outcome is higher than failed outcome.  Month per month towards  end of the year  declining success outcomes. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	I conclude that certain goals have high outcome of success and certain goals have high outcome to fail. Less goal tends to have a greater number of success while greater goals to tends to fail outcomes. No percentage of play canceled to whatever the goal is. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	The data analysis was based on limited specific category and subcategory provided, range of year 2009 to 2017 provided. No data on demographic information 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	For outcome based on Launch Date, I recommend percentage tables in reference to successful, failed and canceled to the grand total. I recommend category outcomes tables and visualization should have provided to show category theater have more success outcomes to all categories.
